# VATSIM ATC Station Status

Have you ever wanted a simple script to monitor the statis of ATC at your favourite airport on VATSIM? Then look no further.
VatsimStationStatus solves this issue by providing a number of scripts to accomidate a number of scenarios.

The script in the root directory is the script currently under development, with previous (completed) scripts in the /old_scripts directory. Unfortuantly, these older scripts are unikely to recieve bug fixes.

## Still in developmment:
- [ ] Inpliment setting of station at startup.
- [X] Impliment Discord webhook intergration.
- [ ] Improve Discord webhook intergration to only post on station status change.
